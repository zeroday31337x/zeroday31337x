## About Me

Iâ€™m Justen Vannocker â€” a cybersecurity expert and full-stack developer with over 20 years of experience in exploit development, network defense, and secure SaaS design.

Once active in the underground hacking scene, Iâ€™ve since transitioned into white hat work â€” helping secure enterprise systems,
lead red team operations, analyze malware, and build tools that make tech more secure and user-friendly.
